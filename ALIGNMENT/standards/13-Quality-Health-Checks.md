# 13. Quality & Health Checks

**Prerequisites:** 
- [Section 0: Prerequisites](00-Prerequisites.md) - Complete decision points
- All P0 sections (1-12) should be completed first

**Effort Estimate:**
- **Basic quality checks (P0):** 1-2 hours
- **Automated health scoring (P1):** 4-8 hours
- **Compliance validation (P1):** 2-4 hours additional
- **DORA metrics tracking (P2):** 4-8 hours additional

## 🎯 What You're Trying to Accomplish
Define quality gates and health checks so the repo stays reliable over time.

## 🎓 Why This Section Exists
Quality drifts without regular checks. Automated health checks keep standards consistent and prevent regressions.

## 📚 Key Concepts (Mentor Mode)

### Quality gates
**Simple:** Rules that code must pass before merging.
**Why it matters:** Prevents low‑quality changes from landing.

### Compliance checks
**Simple:** Automated checks for required files and structure.
**Why it matters:** Keeps the repo aligned with standards.

### DORA metrics
**Simple:** Team performance measures like deploy frequency and lead time.
**Why it matters:** Indicates delivery health.

## Core Principles

Apply these principles to every decision:

- ✅ **Intentional**: Everything must have a clear purpose. No guesswork.
- ✅ **Discoverable**: Everything must be findable in under 1 minute.
- ✅ **Documented**: Everything must be documented at the appropriate level for the repo.
- ✅ **Consistent**: Everything must follow consistent patterns across the project.

## Decision: What quality checks do you need?

**Assess your requirements:**

**Basic Quality (All Projects):**
- [ ] Repository builds from scratch
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No broken links in documentation
- [ ] Fresh clone and build works

**Automated Health Scoring (Recommended):**
- [ ] Health scoring system (0-100 scale)
- [ ] Automated health checker script
- [ ] Health report generation
- [ ] CI/CD integration

**Compliance Validation (Production):**
- [ ] Compliance validation CI job
- [ ] PR compliance checks
- [ ] Compliance reporting

**DORA Metrics (Advanced):**
- [ ] Deployment frequency tracking
- [ ] Lead time measurement
- [ ] MTTR tracking
- [ ] Change failure rate tracking

**Action:** Implement quality checks appropriate to your project | **USER**
- [ ] Start with basic quality (P0)
- [ ] Add automated health scoring (P1)
- [ ] Consider compliance validation for production (P1)
- [ ] Add DORA metrics for advanced teams (P2)

## Verification

**Manual Check:**
- [ ] Test fresh clone: `git clone <repo> && cd <repo> && <build-command>`
- [ ] Verify all tests pass: Run test suite locally
- [ ] Check for broken links: Use link checker (markdown-link-check, etc.)
- [ ] Verify no missing directories referenced in docs
- [ ] If P1 completed: Run health check script and verify score
- [ ] If P1 completed: Check compliance validation runs in CI

**Automated Check (Future):**
```bash
./scripts/validate-section-13.sh
```

**Done Criteria:**
- ✅ Repository builds from scratch successfully
- ✅ All tests pass locally and on CI
- ✅ No broken links in documentation
- ✅ Health check script runs successfully (if P1 completed)
- ✅ Compliance validation configured (if P1 completed)

## Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** "Repository doesn't build from scratch"  
- **Solution:** 
  - Test: Clone to fresh directory and try to build
  - Check README instructions are complete and accurate
  - Verify all dependencies are documented
  - Fix any missing steps or dependencies
  - Document the complete setup process

**Issue:** "Tests pass locally but fail in CI"  
- **Solution:** 
  - Check Node.js/Python/Go version matches CI
  - Verify environment variables are set in CI
  - Check for platform-specific issues (Windows vs Linux)
  - Ensure all dependencies are in lockfile
  - Test in Docker container to match CI environment

**Issue:** "I have broken links in documentation"  
- **Solution:** 
  - Use link checker: `markdown-link-check README.md`
  - Fix broken links or remove them
  - Add link checking to CI/CD (prevent future breaks)
  - Check external links periodically (they can break over time)

**Issue:** "Health scoring seems complicated"  
- **Solution:** 
  - Start with simple checks: Required files exist, structure is correct
  - Use the template script from [Templates.md](Templates.md)
  - Add more checks incrementally
  - Focus on P0 requirements first (40 points), then P1 (30 points)

**Issue:** "I don't know what DORA metrics are"  
- **Solution:** 
  - DORA = DevOps Research and Assessment
  - Four metrics: Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, change failure rate
  - Used to measure team performance
  - This is P2 (advanced), skip if not needed
  - Focus on basic quality first, add metrics later
