# 0. Prerequisites & Setup

**Prerequisites:** None (this is the starting point)

## 🎯 What You're Trying to Accomplish
Figure out what kind of project you have so the rest of ALIGNMENT gives you the right advice. This is a short questionnaire that tailors all later sections to your situation.

## 🎓 Why This Section Exists
Different project types need different rules. A versioned library needs a CHANGELOG; a one‑off script doesn’t. These decisions prevent you from doing unnecessary work and help avoid security mistakes early.

## 📚 Key Concepts (Mentor Mode)

### Versioned project
**Simple:** Code that other people install and rely on; you must communicate changes with versions.
**Why it matters:** Determines whether you need `CHANGELOG.md` and semantic versioning.

### Monorepo
**Simple:** Multiple related projects in one repository.
**Why it matters:** Changes how you organize source code and dependencies.

### Package manager
**Simple:** The tool that installs dependencies (npm, pip, cargo, etc.).
**Why it matters:** Determines your lockfile and dependency rules.

### CI/CD
**Simple:** Automated checks that run when you push code.
**Why it matters:** Determines where pipeline files live and how quality checks run.

### Secrets vs. configuration
**Simple:** Secrets are passwords/tokens; configuration is non‑secret settings.
**Why it matters:** Secrets must never be committed. This affects Section 3 and Section 10.

## 🤔 Decision Checkpoints (Mentor Mode)
- What type of project is this (library, app, API, monorepo, docs‑only)?
- What language and package manager will you use?
- What CI/CD platform (if any) will run your checks?
- Is the repo public or private?
- Do you have secrets in the repo right now?

## ✅ Subtasks (With Owner Tags)

#### Subtask 0.1 — Gather project facts | **USER**
**Purpose:** Make sure decisions reflect reality.
**What you’ll do:** Identify repo type, language, package manager, and CI/CD platform.
**Expected outcome:** Clear answers for each decision point.

#### Subtask 0.2 — Record decisions in `alignment-progress.json` | **USER**
**Purpose:** Keep a single source of truth for later sections.
**Expected outcome:** Decision answers documented.

#### Subtask 0.3 — Validate consistency across answers | **AGENT**
**Purpose:** Catch conflicts (e.g., monorepo + no package manager).
**Expected outcome:** Any mismatches flagged for correction.

#### Subtask 0.4 — Share the decision summary | **USER**
**Purpose:** Align the team on the chosen path.
**Expected outcome:** Decisions communicated to collaborators.

## Key Concepts Explained

### What is a lockfile?
A lockfile (e.g., `package-lock.json`, `poetry.lock`, `Cargo.lock`) locks dependency versions to ensure consistent installs across environments. **Always commit lockfiles** to version control.

### What is CI/CD?
**CI (Continuous Integration):** Automated testing and validation on every code change  
**CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery):** Automated deployment to environments  
**Purpose:** Catch issues early, ensure quality, automate releases

### What is a monorepo?
A repository containing multiple related projects/packages. Examples: `apps/` + `packages/` structure, or multiple services in one repo.

### What is SAST?
**Static Application Security Testing** - Automated code analysis to find security vulnerabilities before deployment.

### What is structured logging?
Logging in a consistent format (typically JSON) that machines can parse, enabling better search, filtering, and analysis.

### What is a CODEOWNERS file?
A file that specifies who must approve changes to specific parts of the codebase. Required for code review automation.

## Document Your Answers

**What this means:** After answering the 10 decision point questions above, you need to save your answers in a JSON file (a structured text file that both humans and computers can read).

**Why it matters:** Your answers guide which tasks you need to do in later sections. Documenting them ensures you (and AI agents) can reference them consistently throughout the alignment process.

### Task: Create alignment-progress.json *(USER/AGENT)*

- [ ] **Create or find the file location:**
  - If `meta/` folder exists → Create `meta/alignment-progress.json`
  - If not → Create `alignment-progress.json` in root (you'll move it to `meta/` in Section 1)

- [ ] **Copy this template and fill in YOUR answers:**
  ```json
  {
    "repository": "my-project-name",
    "started": "2026-01-29",
    "decision_points": {
      "is_versioned_project": true,
      "project_type": "application",
      "primary_language": "JavaScript",
      "package_manager": "npm",
      "cicd_platform": "github",
      "is_public_repo": true,
      "structure_type": "application",
      "has_code_in_root": true,
      "has_secrets_in_repo": false,
      "repository_owners": ["your-github-username"]
    }
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Replace the example values** with your actual answers from above:
  - `"my-project-name"` → your repository name
  - `"2026-01-29"` → today's date
  - `true` → `false` (or vice versa) based on your answers
  - `"application"` → your actual project type
  - `"JavaScript"` → your actual primary language
  - etc.

- [ ] **Save the file**

- [ ] **Commit to Git:**
  ```bash
  git add alignment-progress.json
  git commit -m "Add alignment decision points"
  ```

**Example for a Python web API:**
```json
{
  "repository": "my-api",
  "started": "2026-01-29",
  "decision_points": {
    "is_versioned_project": true,
    "project_type": "api",
    "primary_language": "Python",
    "package_manager": "poetry",
    "cicd_platform": "github",
    "is_public_repo": false,
    "structure_type": "application",
    "has_code_in_root": true,
    "has_secrets_in_repo": false,
    "repository_owners": ["api-team"]
  }
}
```

**Note:** Additional questions will appear in later sections as needed. You'll add them to this same file when you reach those sections.

## Verification

**Before proceeding to Section 1, verify:**
- [ ] Git repository is initialized/cloned
- [ ] Package manager is chosen
- [ ] You've answered all 10 decision point questions above
- [ ] Answers documented in `alignment-progress.json`
- [ ] ⚠️ If secrets exist in repo: Remediation plan created
- [ ] You understand the key concepts (or have them bookmarked for reference)

## Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** "I haven't chosen a package manager yet"  
- **Solution:** Choose based on your language:
  - JavaScript/TypeScript → npm (default) or pnpm (faster)
  - Python → pip (simple) or poetry (better dependency management)
  - Go → Built-in (`go mod`)
  - Rust → Cargo (built-in)

**Issue:** "I don't know if my project is versioned"  
- **Solution:** Ask: "Will others install/use this as a dependency?" If yes → versioned. If no → internal tool/app.

**Issue:** "I'm not sure which CI/CD platform to use"  
- **Solution:** 
  - GitHub repo → GitHub Actions (easiest)
  - GitLab repo → GitLab CI (built-in)
  - Self-hosted → Jenkins
  - Small project → Start with GitHub Actions (free for public repos)

**Issue:** "I don't understand some of these concepts"  
- **Solution:** That's okay! The ALIGNMENT standard will guide you. Bookmark this page and refer back as needed. You can also skip advanced concepts (P2) initially.
