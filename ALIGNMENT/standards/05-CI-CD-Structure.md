# 5. CI/CD Structure

**Prerequisites:** 
- [Section 0: Prerequisites](00-Prerequisites.md) - Complete decision points
- [Section 1: Root Directory Structure](01-Root-Directory-Structure.md)
- [Section 3: Configuration & Environment](03-Configuration-Environment.md)
- [Section 4: Dependency Management](04-Dependency-Management.md)

## 🎯 What You're Trying to Accomplish
Set up automated checks so code is tested, linted, and secure every time you push.

## 🎓 Why This Section Exists
Manual checks are easy to skip. CI/CD makes quality and security reliable by running the same steps every time.

## 📚 Key Concepts (Mentor Mode)

### CI (Continuous Integration)
**Simple:** Automatic checks run when code changes.
**Why it matters:** Catches errors before they reach users.

### CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment)
**Simple:** Automated steps to release code.
**Why it matters:** Makes releases consistent and repeatable.

### Pipeline
**Simple:** A list of steps (build, test, lint, scan).
**Why it matters:** Defines what “quality” means for your project.

## ✅ Subtasks (With Owner Tags)

#### Subtask 5.1 — Choose a CI/CD platform | **USER**
**Purpose:** Pick where automation will run.
**Expected outcome:** Platform selected (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.).

#### Subtask 5.2 — Create a minimal pipeline | **AGENT**
**Purpose:** Establish a baseline that runs on every push.
**Expected outcome:** Pipeline runs lint + tests.

#### Subtask 5.3 — Add security checks | **AGENT**
**Purpose:** Detect vulnerabilities and secrets early.
**Expected outcome:** Security scans included in CI.

#### Subtask 5.4 — Configure required secrets | **USER**
**Purpose:** Ensure CI has the credentials it needs.
**Expected outcome:** Secrets stored in the CI platform.

#### Subtask 5.5 — Verify pipeline results | **USER**
**Purpose:** Confirm automation is reliable.
**Expected outcome:** Pipeline passes on main.

## Decision: Which CI/CD platform are you using?

**From Section 0, identify your platform:**
- **GitHub Actions** → `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - [Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
  - [Workflow syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)
- **GitLab CI** → `.gitlab-ci.yml` in root
  - [Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)
  - [.gitlab-ci.yml reference](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/)
- **Jenkins** → `Jenkinsfile` in root
  - [Documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/)
  - [Pipeline syntax](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/)
- **CircleCI** → `.circleci/config.yml`
  - [Documentation](https://circleci.com/docs/)
  - [Configuration reference](https://circleci.com/docs/config-intro/)
- **Azure DevOps** → `azure-pipelines.yml`
  - [Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/)
  - [YAML schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema)
- **Bitbucket Pipelines** → `bitbucket-pipelines.yml`
  - [Documentation](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/get-started-with-bitbucket-pipelines/)
- **Travis CI** → `.travis.yml`
  - [Documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/)
- **Other** → [platform-specific config location]

**Action:** Create CI/CD config file in correct location | **AGENT**
- [ ] Create config file in platform-specific location
- [ ] Use platform-specific syntax (YAML for most platforms)
- [ ] Reference platform documentation (links above)
- [ ] Test configuration in feature branch before merging

## Verification

**Manual Check:**
- [ ] Verify CI/CD config file exists in correct location
- [ ] Check config file syntax is valid (use platform's validation)
- [ ] Verify pipeline runs: Push a commit and check CI/CD status
- [ ] Confirm pipeline includes: build, lint, security checks (Phase 1)
- [ ] Verify pipeline blocks merges on failure (check branch protection settings)
- [ ] If Phase 2 complete: verify test step runs and blocks on failure
- [ ] Check CI/CD documentation exists (README or `docs/ci-cd.md`)

**Automated Check (Future):**
```bash
./scripts/validate-section-5.sh
```

**Done Criteria:**
- ✅ CI/CD config file exists and is valid
- ✅ Pipeline runs successfully (build, lint, security checks)
- ✅ Pipeline blocks merges on failure
- ✅ CI/CD process documented
- ✅ Test step added (if Phase 2 completed)

## Rollback Procedures

If CI/CD changes break builds:

**Option 1: Restore previous CI/CD config**
```bash
# GitHub Actions
git checkout <previous-commit> -- .github/workflows/ci.yml

# GitLab CI
git checkout <previous-commit> -- .gitlab-ci.yml

# Jenkins
git checkout <previous-commit> -- Jenkinsfile
```

**Option 2: Disable CI/CD temporarily**
```bash
# Rename config file to disable
mv .github/workflows/ci.yml .github/workflows/ci.yml.disabled
# Or comment out in GitLab CI
```

**Option 3: Revert to backup**
```bash
# If you backed up config before changes
cp .github/workflows/ci.yml.backup .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

**Option 4: Fix incrementally**
- Revert to Phase 1 (build + lint only)
- Fix issues
- Re-add test step after fixing

**Prevention:** Test CI/CD in feature branch before merging to main.

## Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** "I don't know which CI/CD platform to use"  
- **Solution:** 
  - GitHub repository → GitHub Actions (easiest, free for public repos)
  - GitLab repository → GitLab CI (built-in, free)
  - Self-hosted → Jenkins (requires setup)
  - Small project → Start with GitHub Actions

**Issue:** "My CI/CD pipeline isn't running"  
- **Solution:** 
  - Check config file syntax: Use platform's validation tool
  - Verify config file is in correct location
  - Check branch protection: Ensure CI is required to pass
  - Review platform logs for errors
  - Test locally first: `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, etc.

**Issue:** "I'm not using GitHub, but instructions mention .github/"  
- **Solution:** 
  - GitHub Actions → `.github/workflows/`
  - GitLab → `.gitlab-ci.yml` in root
  - Jenkins → `Jenkinsfile` in root
  - CircleCI → `.circleci/config.yml`
  - See platform-specific documentation

**Issue:** "Pipeline passes but should fail"  
- **Solution:** 
  - Check pipeline exit codes (should exit 1 on failure)
  - Verify branch protection rules require CI to pass
  - Ensure test/lint commands actually fail on errors
  - Test by introducing a deliberate error

**Issue:** "I don't know what SAST tools to use"  
- **Solution:** 
  - JavaScript/TypeScript: ESLint with security plugins, Snyk
  - Python: Bandit, Safety
  - Go: Gosec, golangci-lint
  - Rust: Clippy, cargo-audit
  - Multi-language: SonarQube, CodeQL (GitHub)

**Issue:** "Secret scanning isn't finding secrets"  
- **Solution:** 
  - Use multiple tools: git-secrets (pre-commit) + truffleHog (CI)
  - Configure custom patterns for your secret formats
  - Scan git history: `trufflehog git file://. --json`
  - Rotate any found secrets immediately
