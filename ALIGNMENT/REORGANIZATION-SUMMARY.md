## Key Research Findings (2026)

### Emerging Trends

1. **AI-Assisted Development**
   - Code generation, test generation, documentation generation
   - Intelligent code review, automated refactoring
   - Predictive analytics

2. **Supply Chain Security**
   - SLSA compliance (Level 3+ recommended)
   - SBOM generation (SPDX, CycloneDX)
   - Build attestations, provenance tracking

3. **Observability Everywhere**
   - OpenTelemetry standards
   - CI/CD observability
   - Infrastructure observability
   - Security observability

4. **Policy as Code**
   - OPA (Open Policy Agent)
   - Security policies as code
   - Compliance automation

5. **Developer Experience (DX)**
   - Fast feedback loops
   - Automated tooling
   - Reduced cognitive load

### Standards Updated (2026)

- **SLSA v1.0** - Supply chain security framework
- **OpenTelemetry** - Observability standard
- **SPDX 3.0** - Software package data exchange
- **FAIR Principles** - Research data standards
- **DORA Metrics** - Developer productivity

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. ✅ **Reorganization** - Complete
2. ✅ **Research** - Complete
3. ⏳ **Update References** - Update cross-references in standards files
4. ⏳ **Verify Links** - Ensure all links work after reorganization

### Future Enhancements

- Add more detailed research files for remaining topics
- Create research templates for consistency
- Add research citations and references
- Create research update schedule

## File Reference Updates Needed

The following files may need cross-reference updates:
- Standards files (00-13) - Update links to reference materials
- Getting started guides - Update links to standards
- Reference materials - Update internal links
- Supporting docs - Update links to standards

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Scalability** - Easy to add new standards, references, or tools
2. **Discoverability** - Logical grouping makes files easy to find
3. **Maintainability** - Related files are grouped together
4. **Clarity** - Clear separation of concerns
5. **Growth** - Structure supports expansion without reorganization

## Notes

- All research is current as of 2026-01-28
- Research includes both proven practices and emerging trends
- Research covers fundamentals through advanced techniques
- References included for further reading
