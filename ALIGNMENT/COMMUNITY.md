4. **Decision** - Maintainers make final decision considering community input
5. **Implementation** - Approved proposals implemented via PR

### Standards Evolution

**Adding New Standards:**
1. Open GitHub Discussion with proposal
2. Minimum 14-day community feedback period

4. Submit PR with research + standard + principle (if applicable)
5. Maintainer approval required
