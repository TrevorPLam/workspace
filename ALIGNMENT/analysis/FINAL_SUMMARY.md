## 🎯 THE PROBLEM (Current State)

**ALIGNMENT standards are:**
- ❌ Heavy with jargon (monorepo, SAST, CODEOWNERS)
- ❌ Overwhelming task lists (P0/P1/P2 mixed)
- ❌ No ownership clarity (who does what?)
- ❌ Abstract concepts without analogies
- ❌ Missing glossary for beginners
- ❌ Hard to navigate for non-experts

**Result:** 50% beginner success rate, long onboarding time

---

## 💡 THE SOLUTION (What We're Building)

### 1. Mentor-Mode Language ✅
Transform dense technical writing into beginner-friendly explanations:
```
BEFORE: "Monorepo structure with apps/ + packages/ directories requires 
careful workspacing to avoid dependency bloat."

AFTER: "A monorepo keeps multiple projects in one repository - like one 
company with multiple teams sharing some tools but working independently."
```

### 2. Decomposed Subtasks with Ownership ✅
Break complex tasks into small, actionable items with clear AGENT/USER tags:
```
BEFORE: 10-step task "Set up repository structure"

AFTER: 
- Subtask 1.1 - Audit current root files | **USER** | 15 min
- Subtask 1.2 - Move config files | **AGENT** | 10 min
- Subtask 1.3 - Clean artifacts | **USER** | 10 min
```

### 3. Comprehensive Glossary ✅
50+ terms explained with why it matters, examples, analogies:
```
Monorepo:
- Simple: One repo with multiple projects
- Why: Share code, coordinate changes
- Example: Frontend + Backend + Shared UI in one repo
- Analogy: One company building with multiple teams
```

### 4. Action-Oriented Structure ✅
Clear template all sections will follow:
1. What You're Accomplishing (goal)
2. Key Concepts (explained simply)
3. Decision Checkpoints (separated from tasks)
4. Subtasks (small, focused, tagged)
5. Common Pitfalls (what beginners miss)
6. Learn More (for deeper understanding)

- Mentor-mode language (not dumbed-down, but accessible)
- Clear AGENT/USER ownership (no ambiguity)
- Decomposed subtasks (not 10-step monster tasks)
- Glossary completeness (all jargon explained)

⚠️ **Important:**
- User testing (validate approach early)
- Template reusability (save time scaling)
- Team alignment (everyone on same page)
- Documentation (record decisions)

## 🚀 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEP

**→ Option B: Pilot First (RECOMMENDED)**

1. **Schedule Phase 1 Kickoff** (this week)
2. **Complete PRIORITY 1 tasks** (next 2 weeks)
   - Master Template
   - Master Glossary
   - Pilot Section 00
3. **Collect user feedback** (end of Week 2)
4. **Make Go/No-Go decision** (early Week 3)
5. **Proceed with full rollout or adjust**

**Why:** Low risk, proves concept, validates approach
