## What is ALIGNMENT?

ALIGNMENT stands for a **repository alignment standard** - a set of guidelines and best practices that help you structure your code repositories (the folders where you store your code) in a consistent, professional way.

### Why Does This Matter?

When you work on software projects, especially in teams, having a consistent structure makes it easier to:
- **Find files quickly** - Everyone knows where things are located
- **Onboard new team members** - Clear structure helps new people understand the project
- **Maintain code quality** - Standards help prevent common mistakes
- **Automate tasks** - Consistent structure enables better automation
- **Scale projects** - Good organization supports growth

### Key Concepts Explained

**Repository (Repo):** A folder containing your project's code, documentation, and configuration files. Usually managed with Git (a version control system).

**Standard:** A set of rules or guidelines that define how something should be done. ALIGNMENT provides 14 standards covering different aspects of repository organization.

**Principle:** A fundamental belief or philosophy that guides decision-making. ALIGNMENT includes 6 principles that explain the "why" behind the standards.

**Priority Tiers:** ALIGNMENT uses three priority levels:
- **P0 (Priority Zero):** Required - Must have these items
- **P1 (Priority One):** Strongly Recommended - Should have these items
- **P2 (Priority Two):** Advanced/Optional - Nice to have, especially for larger projects

#### Standard 0: Prerequisites & Setup
- **Purpose:** Initial decision-making and setup
- **Key Questions:**
  - Is this a versioned project? (Do you release versions?)
  - What type of project? (Library, Application, CLI Tool, etc.)

- Questions to Answer (decision points)
- P0/P1/P2 Actions (prioritized checklists)
- Verification (how to confirm completion)
- Done Criteria (what "done" looks like)
- Common Issues & Solutions (troubleshooting)

---

### 3. Principles Folder (Philosophical Foundations)

**Location:** `principles/`  
**Count:** 6 principle documents  
**Purpose:** Explain the "why" behind the standards

Principles are **standalone documents** that provide the philosophical foundation for standards. They explain core concepts and rationale, while standards provide step-by-step implementation.

**Key Distinction:**
- **Principles = Why and What** (philosophy and concepts)
- **Standards = How** (implementation checklists)

#### Available Principles:

1. **Configuration Principles**
   - Core Idea: "Treat config like code: versioned, validated, layered, and boring"
   - Explains: Configuration layering model, schema validation

2. **Testing Principles**
   - Core Idea: "Tests are specifications, documentation, and safety nets"
   - Explains: Test pyramid, Test-Driven Development (TDD), coverage philosophy

3. **Security Principles**
   - Core Idea: "Security is not a feature—it's a fundamental requirement"
   - Explains: Defense in depth, least privilege, secure by default

4. **Change Management Principles**
   - Core Idea: "Version numbers communicate intent. Changes communicate impact."
   - Explains: Semantic Versioning, breaking changes, deprecation strategy

5. **Documentation Principles**
   - Core Idea: "Documentation is code. It should be versioned, reviewed, tested, and kept current."
   - Explains: Docs as code, FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)

6. **Governance Principles**
   - Core Idea: "Clear ownership enables accountability. Open contribution enables growth."
   - Explains: Ownership models, code review philosophy, contribution processes

**How Principles Work:**
1. Principle defines the philosophy → Provides "why" and core concepts
2. Standard references the principle → Links implementation to philosophy
3. Standard provides checklists → Converts principles into actionable steps
4. Research provides evidence → Supports both principles and standards

## Architecture Analysis

### 7-Layer Information Architecture

ALIGNMENT uses a sophisticated 7-layer architecture that separates different types of information:

```
Layer 1: Entry Points (README, getting-started)
    ↓
Layer 2: Principles (philosophical foundations)
    ↓
Layer 3: Standards (implementation checklists)
    ↓
Layer 4: Research (evidence base)
    ↓
Layer 5: Reference (templates, quick starts)
    ↓
Layer 6: Supporting (FAQ, guides, metrics)
    ↓
Layer 7: Tools & Meta (automation, config)
```

**Why This Structure?**
- **Clear Separation:** Each layer has a distinct purpose
- **Natural Flow:** Information flows logically from philosophy to implementation
- **Scalable:** Easy to add new content without reorganization
- **Discoverable:** Clear organization makes finding information easy

### Information Flow

**Typical User Journey:**
1. Start at README.md (entry point)
2. Choose a path: New repo → Quick Start, or Existing repo → Migration Guide
3. Read relevant principles (understand "why")
4. Follow standards (implement "how")
5. Use reference materials (templates, examples)
6. Get help from supporting docs (FAQ, pitfalls)
7. Use tools (validation, progress tracking)

### Cross-Reference Patterns

ALIGNMENT uses consistent cross-referencing:
- **Standards → Principles:** Standards link to related principles
- **Standards → Research:** Standards reference supporting research
- **Standards → Standards:** Standards reference prerequisite sections
- **Principles → Standards:** Principles link to implementing standards
- **All use relative paths:** Works regardless of where ALIGNMENT is hosted

---

## Consistency Analysis

### Overall Consistency: ✅ **Excellent**

ALIGNMENT demonstrates **high consistency** across:
- File naming conventions (all standards use `XX-Section-Name.md` format)
- Document structure (all standards follow same template)
- Cross-reference patterns (consistent relative path usage)
- Formatting standards (uniform markdown formatting)
- Principles integration (consistent where applicable)

### Key Consistency Strengths:

1. **File Naming:** All standards numbered 00-13, all principles use `[Topic]-Principles.md`
2. **Document Structure:** All standards have Prerequisites, Effort Estimate, P0/P1/P2 sections, Verification, Done Criteria
3. **Cross-References:** All use relative paths consistently
4. **Principles:** Only standards that need principles have them (6 of 14 standards)

### Minor Variations:

- **Section Order:** Slight variations in section order (doesn't affect functionality)
- **Done Criteria Format:** Mostly consistent, minor variations (cosmetic only)

**Verdict:** No critical inconsistencies found. The workspace is highly consistent and well-structured.

4. Assess risk (Low/Medium/High)
5. Calculate ROI (Return on Investment)
6. Make decision (Go/Defer/No-Go)

**Priority Formula:**
```
Priority = (Impact × 3) - (Effort × 1) - (Risk × 2)
```
